# Usage notes<a name="r_GRANT-usage-notes"></a>

To grant privileges on an object, you must meet one of the following criteria:
+ Be the object owner\.
+ Be a superuser\.
+ Have a grant privilege for that object and privilege\.

For example, the following command enables the user HR both to perform SELECT commands on the employees table and to grant and revoke the same privilege for other users\.

```
grant select on table employees to HR with grant option;
```

HR can't grant privileges for any operation other than SELECT, or on any other table than employees\. 

As another example, the following command enables the user HR both to perform ALTER commands on the employees table and to grant and revoke the same privilege for other users\.

```
grant ALTER on datashare employees to HR with grant option;
```

HR can't grant privileges for any operation other than ALTER, or on any other data share than employees\. 

Having privileges granted on a view doesn't imply having privileges on the underlying tables\. Similarly, having privileges granted on a schema doesn't imply having privileges on the tables in the schema\. Instead, grant access to the underlying tables explicitly\.

To grant privileges to an AWS Lake Formation table, the IAM role associated with the table's external schema must have permission to grant privileges to the external table\. The following example creates an external schema with an associated IAM role `myGrantor`\. The IAM role `myGrantor` has the permission to grant permissions to others\. The GRANT command uses the permission of the IAM role `myGrantor` that is associated with the external schema to grant permission to the IAM role `myGrantee`\.

```
create external schema mySchema
from data catalog
database 'spectrum_db'
iam_role 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/myGrantor'
create external database if not exists;
```

```
grant select 
on external table mySchema.mytable
to iam_role 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/myGrantee';
```

If you GRANT ALL privileges to an IAM role, individual privileges are granted in the related Lake Formationâ€“enabled Data Catalog\. For example, the following GRANT ALL results in the granted individual privileges \(SELECT, ALTER, DROP, DELETE, and INSERT\) showing in the Lake Formation console\.

```
grant all 
on external table mySchema.mytable
to iam_role 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/myGrantee';
```

Superusers can access all objects regardless of GRANT and REVOKE commands that set object privileges\.

## Usage notes for column\-level access control<a name="r_GRANT-usage-notes-clp"></a>

The following usage notes apply to column\-level privileges on Amazon Redshift tables and views\. These notes describe tables; the same notes apply to views unless we explicitly note an exception\. 

For an Amazon Redshift table, you can grant only the SELECT and UPDATE privileges at the column level\. For an Amazon Redshift view, you can grant only the SELECT privilege at the column level\. 

The ALL keyword is a synonym for SELECT and UPDATE privileges combined when used in the context of a column\-level GRANT on a table\. 

If you don't have SELECT privilege on all columns in a table, performing a SELECT operation for all columns \(`SELECT *`\) fails\.

If you have SELECT or UPDATE privilege on a table or view and add a column, you still have the same privileges on the table or view and thus all its columns\. 

Only a table's owner or a superuser can grant column\-level privileges\. 

The WITH GRANT OPTION clause isn't supported for column\-level privileges\.

You can't hold the same privilege at both the table level and the column level\. For example, the user `data_scientist` can't have both SELECT privilege on the table `employee` and SELECT privilege on the column `employee.department`\. Consider the following results when granting the same privilege to a table and a column within the table:
+ If a user has a table\-level privilege on a table, then granting the same privilege at the column level has no effect\. 
+ If a user has a table\-level privilege on a table, then revoking the same privilege for one or more columns of the table returns an error\. Instead, revoke the privilege at the table level\. 
+ If a user has a column\-level privilege, then granting the same privilege at the table level returns an error\. 
+ If a user has a column\-level privilege, then revoking the same privilege at the table level revokes both column and table privileges for all columns on the table\. 

You can't grant column\-level privileges on late\-binding views\.

To create a materialized view, you must have table\-level SELECT privilege on the base tables\. Even if you have column\-level privileges on specific columns, you can't create a materialized view on only those columns\. However, you can grant SELECT privilege to columns of a materialized view, similar to regular views\. 

To look up grants of column\-level privileges, use the [PG\_ATTRIBUTE\_INFO](r_PG_ATTRIBUTE_INFO.md) view\. 

## Usage notes for granting the ASSUMEROLE privilege<a name="r_GRANT-usage-notes-assumerole"></a>

The following usage notes apply to granting the ASSUMEROLE privilege in Amazon Redshift\. 

You use the ASSUMEROLE privilege to control IAM role access privileges for database users and groups on commands such as COPY and UNLOAD\. After you grant the ASSUMEROLE privilege to a user or group on an IAM role, the user or group is able to assume that role when running the command\. This enables you to grant access to the appropriate commands as required\.

Only a database superuser can grant or revoke the ASSUMEROLE privilege for users and groups\. A superuser always retains the ASSUMEROLE privilege\.  

To enable the use of the ASSUMEROLE privilege for users and groups, a superuser runs the following statement once on the cluster\. The superuser must run the following statement once on the cluster before granting the ASSUMEROLE privilege to users and groups\.

```
revoke assumerole on all from public for all;
```

You can specify role chaining in the ON clause when granting the ASSUMEROLE privilege\. You use commas to separate roles in a role chain, for example, `Role1,Role2,Role3`\. If role chaining was specified when granting the ASSUMEROLE privilege, you must specify the role chain when performing operations granted by the ASSUMEROLE privilege\. You can't specify individual roles within the role chain when performing operations granted by the ASSUMEROLE privilege\. For example, if a user or group is granted the role chain `Role1,Role2,Role3`, you can't specify only `Role1` to perform operations\.  

If a user attempts to perform a COPY or UNLOAD operation and has not been granted the ASSUMEROLE privilege, a message similar to the following appears\.

```
ERROR:  User awsuser does not have ASSUMEROLE permission on IAM role "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/RoleA" for COPY 
```

To list IAM roles and command privileges that have been granted to a user that you specify, see [PG\_GET\_IAM\_ROLE\_BY\_USER](PG_GET_IAM_ROLE_BY_USER.md)\. To list users and groups that have been granted access to an IAM role that you specify, see [PG\_GET\_GRANTEE\_BY\_IAM\_ROLE](PG_GET_GRANTEE_BY_IAMROLE.md)\.
