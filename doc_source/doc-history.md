| Short query acceleration in Amazon Redshift workload management \(WLM\)  | Short query acceleration \(SQA\) prioritizes selected short\-running queries ahead of longer\-running queries\. SQA executes short\-running queries in a dedicated space, so that SQA queries aren't forced to wait in queues behind longer queries\. With SQA, short\-running queries begin executing more quickly and users see results sooner\. For more information, see [Working with short query acceleration](wlm-short-query-acceleration.md)\.  | November 16, 2017 | 
| WLM reassigns hopped queries | Instead of canceling and restarting a hopped query, Amazon Redshift workload management \(WLM\) now reassigns eligible queries to a new queue\. When WLM reassigns a query, it moves the query to the new queue and continues execution, which saves time and system resources\. Hopped queries that are not eligible to be reassigned are restarted or canceled\. For more information, see [WLM query queue hopping](wlm-queue-hopping.md)\.  | November 16, 2017 | 
| System log access for users | In most system log tables that are visible to users, rows generated by another user are invisible to a regular user by default\. To permit a regular user to see all rows in user\-visible tables, including rows generated by another user, run [ALTER USER](r_ALTER_USER.md) or [CREATE USER](r_CREATE_USER.md) and set the [SYSLOG ACCESS](r_ALTER_USER.md#alter-user-syslog-access) parameter to UNRESTRICTED\. | November 16, 2017 | 
| Result caching | With [ Result caching ](c_challenges_achieving_high_performance_queries.md#result-caching), when you run a query Amazon Redshift caches the result\. When you run the query again, Amazon Redshift checks for a valid, cached copy of the query result\. If a match is found in the result cache, Amazon Redshift uses the cached result and doesn't execute the query\. Result caching is enabled by default\. To disable result caching, set the [enable\_result\_cache\_for\_session](r_enable_result_cache_for_session.md) configuration parameter to off\. | November 16, 2017 | 
| Column metadata functions | [PG\_GET\_COLS](PG_GET_COLS.md) and [PG\_GET\_LATE\_BINDING\_VIEW\_COLS](PG_GET_LATE_BINDING_VIEW_COLS.md) return column metadata for Amazon Redshift tables, views, and late\-binding views\.  | November 16, 2017 | 
| WLM queue hopping for CTAS | Amazon Redshift workload management \(WLM\) now supports query queue hopping for [CREATE TABLE AS](r_CREATE_TABLE_AS.md) \(CTAS\) statements as well as read\-only queries, such as SELECT statements\. For more information, see [WLM query queue hopping](wlm-queue-hopping.md)\.  | October 19, 2017 | 
| Amazon Redshift Spectrum manifest files | When you create a Redshift Spectrum external table, you can specify a manifest file that lists the locations of data files on Amazon S3\. For more information, see [CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE](r_CREATE_EXTERNAL_TABLE.md)\.  | October 19, 2017 | 
| Amazon Redshift Spectrum new AWS Regions | Redshift Spectrum is now available in the EU \(Ireland\) and Asia Pacific \(Tokyo\) Regions\. For a list of supported AWS Regions, see [Amazon Redshift Spectrum considerations](c-using-spectrum.md#c-spectrum-considerations)\.  | October 19, 2017 | 
| Amazon Redshift Spectrum added file formats | You can now create Redshift Spectrum external tables based on Regex, OpenCSV, and Avro data file formats\. For more information, see [CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE](r_CREATE_EXTERNAL_TABLE.md)\.  | October 5, 2017 | 
| Pseudocolumns for Amazon Redshift Spectrum external tables | You can select the $path and $size pseudocolumns in a Redshift Spectrum external table to view the location and size of the referenced data files in Amazon S3\. For more information, see [Pseudocolumns](c-spectrum-external-tables.md#c-spectrum-external-tables-pseudocolumns)\.  | October 5, 2017 | 
| Functions to validate JSON | You can use the [IS\_VALID\_JSON](IS_VALID_JSON.md) and [IS\_VALID\_JSON\_ARRAY](IS_VALID_JSON_ARRAY.md) functions to check for valid JSON formatting\. The other JSON functions now have an optional null\_if\_invalid argument\.  | October 5, 2017 | 
| LISTAGG DISTINCT | You can use the DISTINCT clause with the [LISTAGG](r_LISTAGG.md) aggregate function and the [LISTAGG](r_WF_LISTAGG.md) window function to eliminate duplicate values from the specified expression before concatenating\.  | October 5, 2017 | 
| View column names in uppercase | To view column names in SELECT results in uppercase, you can set the [describe\_field\_name\_in\_uppercase](r_describe_field_name_in_uppercase.md) configuration parameter to true\.  | October 5, 2017 | 
| Skip header lines in external tables | You can set the skip\.header\.line\.count property in the [CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE](r_CREATE_EXTERNAL_TABLE.md) command to skip header lines at the beginning of Redshift Spectrum data files\.  | October 5, 2017 | 
| Scan row count | WLM query monitor rules uses the scan\_row\_count metric to return the number of rows in a scan step\. The row count is the total number of rows emitted before filtering rows marked for deletion \(ghost rows\) and before applying user\-defined query filters\. For more information, see [Query monitoring metrics](cm-c-wlm-query-monitoring-rules.md#cm-c-wlm-query-monitoring-metrics)\.  | September 21, 2017 | 
| SQL user\-defined functions | A scalar SQL user\-defined function \(UDF\) incorporates a SQL SELECT clause that executes when the function is called and returns a single value\. For more information, see [Creating a scalar SQL UDF](udf-creating-a-scalar-sql-udf.md)\.  | August 31, 2017 | 
| Late\-binding views | A late\-binding view is not bound to the underlying database objects, such as tables and user\-defined functions\. As a result, there is no dependency between the view and the objects it references\. You can create a view even if the referenced objects don't exist\. Because there is no dependency, you can drop or alter a referenced object without affecting the view\. Amazon Redshift doesn't check for dependencies until the view is queried\. To create a late\-binding view, specify the WITH NO SCHEMA BINDING clause with your CREATE VIEW statement\. For more information, see [CREATE VIEW](r_CREATE_VIEW.md)\.  | August 31, 2017 | 
| OCTET\_LENGTH function | [OCTET\_LENGTH](r_OCTET_LENGTH.md) returns the length of the specified string as the number of bytes\.  | August 18, 2017 |

| Query monitoring rules | Using WLM query monitoring rules, you can define metrics\-based performance boundaries for WLM queues and specify what action to take when a query goes beyond those boundaries—log, hop, or abort\. You define query monitoring rules as part of your workload management \(WLM\) configuration\. For more information, see [WLM query monitoring rules](cm-c-wlm-query-monitoring-rules.md)\. | April 21, 2017 | 
| Amazon Redshift Spectrum | Using Redshift Spectrum, you can efficiently query and retrieve data from files in Amazon S3 without having to load the data into tables\. Redshift Spectrum queries execute very fast against large datasets because Redshift Spectrum scans the data files directly in Amazon S3\. Much of the processing occurs in the Amazon Redshift Spectrum layer, and most of the data remains in Amazon S3\. Multiple clusters can concurrently query the same dataset on Amazon S3 without the need to make copies of the data for each cluster\. For more information, see [Querying external data using Amazon Redshift Spectrum](c-using-spectrum.md) | April 19, 2017 |

| New authorization syntax | You can now use the IAM\_ROLE, MASTER\_SYMMETRIC\_KEY, ACCESS\_KEY\_ID, SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY, and SESSION\_TOKEN parameters to provide authorization and access information for COPY, UNLOAD, and CREATE LIBRARY commands\. The new authorization syntax provides a more flexible alternative to providing a single string argument to the CREDENTIALS parameter\. For more information, see [Authorization parameters](copy-parameters-authorization.md)\. | February 9, 2017 | 
| Schema limit increase | You can now create up to 9,900 schemas per cluster\. For more information, see [CREATE SCHEMA](r_CREATE_SCHEMA.md)\. | February 9, 2017 | 
| Default table encoding | [CREATE TABLE](r_CREATE_TABLE_NEW.md) and [ALTER TABLE](r_ALTER_TABLE.md) now assign LZO compression encoding to most new columns\. Columns defined as sort keys, columns that are defined as BOOLEAN, REAL, or DOUBLE PRECISION data types, and temporary tables are assigned RAW encoding by default\. For more information, see [ENCODE](r_CREATE_TABLE_NEW.md#create-table-encode)\. | February 6, 2017 |

| New columns in STL\_CONNECTION\_LOG | The [STL\_CONNECTION\_LOG](r_STL_CONNECTION_LOG.md) system table has two new columns to track SSL connections\. If you routinely load audit logs to an Amazon Redshift table, you will need to add the following new columns to the target table: sslcompression and sslexpansion\. | May 5, 2016 | 
| MD5\-hash password | You can specify the password for a [CREATE USER](r_CREATE_USER.md) or [ALTER USER](r_ALTER_USER.md) command by supplying the MD5\-hash string of the password and user name\. | April 21, 2016 | 
| New column in STV\_TBL\_PERM | The backup column in the [STV\_TBL\_PERM](r_STV_TBL_PERM.md) system view indicates whether the table is included in cluster snapshots\. For more information, see [BACKUP](r_CREATE_TABLE_NEW.md#create-table-backup)\.  | April 21, 2016 | 
| No\-backup tables | For tables, such as staging tables, that won't contain critical data, you can specify BACKUP NO in your [CREATE TABLE](r_CREATE_TABLE_NEW.md) or [CREATE TABLE AS](r_CREATE_TABLE_AS.md) statement to prevent Amazon Redshift from including the table in automated or manual snapshots\. Using no\-backup tables saves processing time when creating snapshots and restoring from snapshots and reduces storage space on Amazon S3\. | April 7, 2016 | 
| VACUUM delete threshold | By default, the [VACUUM](r_VACUUM_command.md) command now reclaims space such that at least 95 percent of the remaining rows are not marked for deletion\. As a result, VACUUM usually needs much less time for the delete phase compared to reclaiming 100 percent of deleted rows\. You can change the default threshold for a single table by including the TO threshold PERCENT parameter when you run the VACUUM command\.  | April 7, 2016 | 
| SVV\_TRANSACTIONS system table | The [SVV\_TRANSACTIONS](r_SVV_TRANSACTIONS.md) system view records information about transactions that currently hold locks on tables in the database\.  | April 7, 2016 | 
| Using IAM roles to access other AWS resources  | To move data between your cluster and another AWS resource, such as Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon EMR, or Amazon EC2, your cluster must have permission to access the resource and perform the necessary actions\. As a more secure alternative to providing an access key pair with COPY, UNLOAD, or CREATE LIBRARY commands, you can now you specify an IAM role that your cluster uses for authentication and authorization\. For more information, see [Role\-based access control](copy-usage_notes-access-permissions.md#copy-usage_notes-access-role-based)\.  | March 29, 2016 | 
| VACUUM sort threshold | The VACUUM command now skips the sort phase for any table where more than 95 percent of the table's rows are already sorted\.

| UNLOAD with bzip2 compression | You now have the option to [UNLOAD](r_UNLOAD.md) using bzip2 compression\.  | February 8, 2016 | 
| ALTER TABLE APPEND | [ALTER TABLE APPEND](r_ALTER_TABLE_APPEND.md) appends rows to a target table by moving data from an existing source table\. ALTER TABLE APPEND is usually much faster than a similar [CREATE TABLE AS](r_CREATE_TABLE_AS.md) or [INSERT](r_INSERT_30.md) INTO operation because data is moved, not duplicated\.  | February 8, 2016 | 
| WLM query queue hopping | If workload management \(WLM\) cancels a read\-only query, such as a SELECT statement, due to a WLM timeout, WLM attempts to route the query to the next matching queue\. For more information, see [WLM query queue hopping](wlm-queue-hopping.md) | January 7, 2016 | 
| ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES | You can use the [ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES](r_ALTER_DEFAULT_PRIVILEGES.md) command to define the default set of access privileges to be applied to objects that are created in the future by the specified user\. | December 10, 2015 |

| STL\_USERLOG system table | [STL\_USERLOG](r_STL_USERLOG.md) records details for changes that occur when a database user is created, altered, or deleted\. | October 3, 2013 | 
| LZO column encoding and LZOP file compression\. | [LZO](lzo-encoding.md) column compression encoding combines a very high compression ratio with good performance\. COPY from Amazon S3 supports loading from files compressed using [LZOP](copy-parameters-file-compression.md#copy-lzop) compression\. | September 19, 2013 | 
| JSON, regular expressions, and cursors | Added support for parsing JSON strings, pattern matching using regular expressions, and using cursors to retrieve large data sets over an ODBC connection\. For more information, see [JSON functions](json-functions.md), [Pattern\-matching conditions](pattern-matching-conditions.md), and [DECLARE](declare.md)\. | September 10, 2013 | 
| ACCEPTINVCHAR option for COPY | You can successfully load data that contains invalid UTF\-8 characters by specifying the ACCEPTINVCHAR option with the [COPY](r_COPY.md) command\. | August 29, 2013 |
