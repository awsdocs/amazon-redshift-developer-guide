## Usage notes<a name="w65aac63c13c11c93c11"></a>

If you see multiple errors with "Connection timed out", you might have a networking issue\. If you're using Enhanced VPC Routing, verify that you have a valid network path between your cluster's VPC and your data resources\. For more information, see [Amazon Redshift Enhanced VPC Routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/enhanced-vpc-routing.html)

## Sample query<a name="w65aac63c13c11c93c13"></a>

The following query returns the errors from COPY commands executed during the current session\.

```
select query, sliceid, substring(key from 1 for 20) as file, 
substring(error from 1 for 35) as error  
from stl_s3client_error 
where pid = pg_backend_pid()
order by query desc;
```

Result

```
 query  | sliceid |     file           |              error
