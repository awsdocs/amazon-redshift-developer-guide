# Creating Amazon Redshift scalar columns out of the shredded data<a name="r_create_scalar"></a>

Schemaless data stored into SUPER can affect performances of Amazon Redshift\. For instance, filter predicates and/or join conditions as range\-restricted scans canâ€™t effectively use zone maps\. Users and BI tools can use materialized views as the conventional schemaful presentation of the data and increase performances of analytical queries\.

The following query scans the materialized view super\_mv and filters on o\_orderstatus\.

```
SELECT c.c_name, v.o_totalprice
FROM customer_orders_lineitem c
JOIN super_mv v ON c.c_custkey = v.c_custkey
WHERE v.o_orderstatus = 'F';
```

Inspect stl\_scan to verify that Amazon Redshift isn't able to effectively use zone maps on the range\-restricted scan over o\_orderstatus\.

```
SELECT slice, is_rrscan FROM stl_scan
WHERE query = pg_last_query_id() AND perm_table_name LIKE '%super_mv%';

 slice | is_rrscan 
-------+-----------
     0 | t
     1 | t
     5 | t
     4 | t
     2 | t
     3 | t
(6 rows)
```

The following example adapts the materialized view super\_mv to create scalar columns out of the shredded data\. In this case, Amazon Redshift casts o\_orderstatus from SUPER to VARCHAR\. In addition, specify o\_orderstatus as sort key for super\_mv\.

```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW super_mv distkey(c_custkey) sortkey(c_custkey, o_orderstatus) AS (
  SELECT c_custkey, o.o_orderstatus::VARCHAR AS o_orderstatus, o.o_totalprice, o_idx
  FROM customer_orders_lineitem c, c.c_orders o AT o_idx
);
```

After re\-running the query, verify that Amazon Redshift can now use zone maps\.

```
SELECT v.o_totalprice
FROM super_mv v
WHERE v.o_orderstatus = 'F';
```

You can verify that the range\-restricted scan now uses zone maps as follows\.

```
SELECT slice, is_rrscan FROM stl_scan 
WHERE query = pg_last_query_id() 
AND perm_table_name 
LIKE '%super_mv%';

 slice | is_rrscan 
-------+-----------
     4 | f
     5 | f
     1 | f
     0 | f
     3 | f
     2 | f
(6 rows)
```
