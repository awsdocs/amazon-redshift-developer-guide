## Sample queries<a name="r_STV_INFLIGHT-sample-queries"></a>

To view all active queries currently running on the database, type the following query: 

```
select * from stv_inflight;
```

The sample output below shows two queries currently running, including the STV\_INFLIGHT query itself and a query that was run from a script called `avgwait.sql`: 

```
select slice, query, trim(label) querylabel, pid,
starttime, substring(text,1,20) querytext
from stv_inflight;

slice|query|querylabel | pid |        starttime         |      querytext
