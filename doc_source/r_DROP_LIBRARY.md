# DROP LIBRARY<a name="r_DROP_LIBRARY"></a>

Removes a custom Python library from the database\. Only the library owner or a superuser can drop a library\. 

DROP LIBRARY can't be run inside a transaction block \(BEGIN â€¦ END\)\. For more information about transactions, see [Serializable isolation](c_serial_isolation.md)\. 

This command isn't reversible\. The DROP LIBRARY command commits immediately\. If a UDF that depends on the library is running concurrently, the UDF might fail, even if the UDF is running within a transaction\.

For more information, see [CREATE LIBRARY](r_CREATE_LIBRARY.md)\.
