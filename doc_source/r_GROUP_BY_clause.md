# GROUP BY clause<a name="r_GROUP_BY_clause"></a>



The GROUP BY clause identifies the grouping columns for the query\. Grouping columns must be declared when the query computes aggregates with standard functions such as SUM, AVG, and COUNT\. For more information, see [Aggregate functions](c_Aggregate_Functions.md)\. 

```
GROUP BY expression [, ...]
```

## *expression*<a name="r_GROUP_BY_clause-expression"></a>

The list of columns or expressions must match the list of non\-aggregate expressions in the select list of the query\. For example, consider the following simple query:

```
select listid, eventid, sum(pricepaid) as revenue,
count(qtysold) as numtix
from sales
group by listid, eventid
order by 3, 4, 2, 1
limit 5;

listid | eventid | revenue | numtix
--------+---------+---------+--------
89397 |      47 |   20.00 |      1
106590 |      76 |   20.00 |      1
124683 |     393 |   20.00 |      1
103037 |     403 |   20.00 |      1
147685 |     429 |   20.00 |      1
(5 rows)
```

In this query, the select list consists of two aggregate expressions\. The first uses the SUM function and the second uses the COUNT function\. The remaining two columns, LISTID and EVENTID, must be declared as grouping columns\.

Expressions in the GROUP BY clause can also reference the select list by using ordinal numbers\. For example, the previous example could be abbreviated as follows:

```
select listid, eventid, sum(pricepaid) as revenue,
count(qtysold) as numtix
from sales
group by 1,2
order by 3, 4, 2, 1
limit 5;

listid | eventid | revenue | numtix
--------+---------+---------+--------
89397 |      47 |   20.00 |      1
106590 |      76 |   20.00 |      1
124683 |     393 |   20.00 |      1
103037 |     403 |   20.00 |      1
147685 |     429 |   20.00 |      1
(5 rows)
```
