+ Character literals, also referred to as strings, character strings, or character constants
+ Datetime and interval literals, used with datetime data types\. For more information, see [Date, time, and timestamp literals](r_Date_and_time_literals.md) and [Interval literals](r_interval_literals.md)\.
