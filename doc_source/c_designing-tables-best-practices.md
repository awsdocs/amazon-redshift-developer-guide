# Amazon Redshift best practices for designing tables<a name="c_designing-tables-best-practices"></a>

As you plan your database, certain key table design decisions heavily influence overall query performance\. These design choices also have a significant effect on storage requirements, which in turn affects query performance by reducing the number of I/O operations and minimizing the memory required to process queries\.

In this section, you can find a summary of the most important design decisions and presents best practices for optimizing query performance\. [Working with automatic table optimization](t_Creating_tables.md) provides more detailed explanations and examples of table design options\.
