# How machine learning can solve your problem<a name="solve_problem"></a>

A machine learning model generates predictions by finding patterns in your training data and then applying these patterns to new data\. In machine learning, you train these models by learning the patterns that best explain your data\. Then you use the models to make predictions \(also called inferences\) on new data\. Machine learning is typically an iterative process where you can continue to improve the accuracy of the predictions by iteratively changing parameters and improving your training data\. If data changes, retraining new models with the new dataset happens\. 

To address various business goals, there are different fundamental machine learning approaches\. Amazon Redshift supports supervised learning, which is the most common approach to advanced enterprise analytics\. Supervised learning is the preferred machine learning approach when you have an established set of data and an understanding of how specific input data predicts various business outcomes\. These outcomes are sometimes called labels\. In particular, your dataset is a table with attributes that comprise features \(inputs\) and targets \(outputs\)\. For example, suppose that you have a table that provides the age and postal code for past and present customers\. Suppose that you also have a field “active” that is true for present customers and false for customers who have suspended their membership\. The goal of supervised machine learning is to spot the patterns of age and postal code leading to customer churn as represented by customers whose target are “False”\. You can use this model to predict customers who are likely to churn, such as suspending their membership, and potentially offer retention incentives\.

Amazon Redshift supports supervised learning that includes regression, binary classification, and multiclass classification\. Regression refers to the problem of predicting continuous values, such as the total spending of customers\. Binary classification refers to the problem of predicting one of two outcomes, such as predicting whether a customer churns or not\. Multiclass classification refers to the problem of predicting one of many outcomes, such as predicting the item a customer might be interested\. Data analysts and data scientists can use it to perform supervised learning to tackle problems ranging from forecasting, personalization, or customer churn prediction\. You can also use supervised learning in problems such as prediction of which sales will close, revenue prediction, fraud detection and customer life\-time value prediction\.
