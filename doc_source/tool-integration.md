# Integrating business intelligence tools in data sharing<a name="tool-integration"></a>

To integrate data sharing with business intelligence \(BI\) tools, we recommend that you use the Amazon Redshift JDBC or ODBC drivers\. Or query system metadata views such as SVV\_ALL\* and SVV\_REDSHIFT\* system views to view information about all Amazon Redshift database objects for exploration and navigation\. 

These views include objects from the Amazon Redshift database that you are currently connected to\. They also include objects from all the other databases that you have access to on the cluster, including the databases created from the data shares\. In addition, these views include external objects that you can query using Redshift Spectrum and federated queries as part of their respective databases\. You can see the full list of local cluster and shared databases that Amazon Redshift uses to navigate these objects from the SVV\_REDSHIFT\_DATABASES view\. 

You can also use the SVV\_DATASHARES and SVV\_DATASHARE\_OBJECTS system views to view metadata for data shares on any cluster\. If you have explicitly created EXTERNAL SCHEMA references to schemas in other databases, Amazon Redshift also returns the objects in SVV\_EXTERNAL\* system views\. Amazon Redshift JDBC or ODBC drivers supports the `GetCatalogs` API operation in the drivers that returns the list of all databases including databases created from data shares\. The drivers also support downstream operations such as `GetSchemas`, `GetTables`, and so on, that return data from all the databases that `GetCatalogs` returns even when catalog is not explicitly specified in the call\.

You can't connect to remote databases created from data shares directly\. If you have a connection switching user interface in your tool, the list of databases should include only the local cluster databases\. The list should exclude remote databases created from data shares to provide the best experience\. You can use an option in the SVV\_REDSHIFT\_DATABASES view to filter databases\. For more information about JDBC or ODBC drivers, see [Configuring connections in Amazon Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configuring-connections.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide* or [SVV views](svv_views.md)\.
