# Tracking usage and auditing in data sharing<a name="auditing"></a>

Auditing data sharing enables producers to track the data share evolution\. For example, auditing helps track when data shares are created, objects are added or removed, or privileges are granted or revoked to Amazon Redshift clusters\.

In addition to auditing, producers and consumers track data share usage at various granularities, such as cluster and object levels\. For more information about tracking usage and auditing views, see [SVL\_DATASHARE\_CHANGE\_LOG](r_SVL_DATASHARE_CHANGE_LOG.md) and [SVL\_DATASHARE\_USAGE](r_SVL_DATASHARE_USAGE.md)\.
