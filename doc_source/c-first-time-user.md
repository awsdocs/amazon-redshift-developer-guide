# Are you a first\-time Amazon Redshift user?<a name="c-first-time-user"></a>

If you are a first\-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by reading the following sections\.
+ Service Highlights and Pricing – The [product detail page](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) provides the Amazon Redshift value proposition, service highlights, and pricing\.
+ Getting Started – [Amazon Redshift Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/) includes an example that walks you through the process of creating an Amazon Redshift data warehouse cluster, creating database tables, uploading data, and testing queries\. 

After you complete the Getting Started guide, we recommend that you explore one of the following guides:
+ [Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/) – The Cluster Management guide shows you how to create and manage Amazon Redshift clusters\. 

  If you are an application developer, you can use the Amazon Redshift Query API to manage clusters programmatically\. Additionally, the AWS SDK libraries that wrap the underlying Amazon Redshift API can help simplify your programming tasks\. If you prefer a more interactive way of managing clusters, you can use the Amazon Redshift console and the AWS command line interface \(AWS CLI\)\. For information about the API and CLI, go to the following manuals: 
  + [API reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/APIReference/)
  + [CLI reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/redshift/)
+ Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide* \(this document\)* – If you are a database developer, the Database Developer Guide explains how to design, build, query, and maintain the databases that make up your data warehouse\. 

If you are transitioning to Amazon Redshift from another relational database system or data warehouse application, you should be aware of important differences in how Amazon Redshift is implemented\. For a summary of the most important considerations for designing tables and loading data, see [Amazon Redshift best practices for designing tables](c_designing-tables-best-practices.md) and [Amazon Redshift best practices for loading data](c_loading-data-best-practices.md)\. Amazon Redshift is based on PostgreSQL\. For a detailed list of the differences between Amazon Redshift and PostgreSQL, see [Amazon Redshift and PostgreSQL](c_redshift-and-postgres-sql.md)\.
