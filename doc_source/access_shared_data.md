# Accessing shared data<a name="access_shared_data"></a>

You can discover shared data using standard SQL interfaces and JDBC or ODBC drivers\. You can also query data with high performance from familiar business intelligence \(BI\) and analytic tools\. You can perform queries by referring to the objects from other Amazon Redshift databases that are both local to and remote from your cluster that you have permissions to access\.

You can do so simply by staying connected to local databases in your cluster\. Then create consumer databases from data shares to consume shared data\. You can then perform cross\-database queries joining the datasets and query objects in consumer databases using the 3\-part notation, such as *consumer\_database\_name\.schema\_name\.table\_name*, or external schema links to schema in the consumer database\. You can query both local data and data shared from other cluster in same query that references objects of the current connected database, and other non\-connected database including consumer database created from datashare\.
