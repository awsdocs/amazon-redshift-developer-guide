# Split your load data into multiple files<a name="c_best-practices-use-multiple-files"></a>

The COPY command loads the data in parallel from multiple files, dividing the workload among the nodes in your cluster\. When you load all the data from a single large file, Amazon Redshift is forced to perform a serialized load, which is much slower\. Split your load data files so that the files are about equal size, between 1 MB and 1 GB after compression\. For optimum parallelism, the ideal size is between 1 MB and 125 MB after compression\. The number of files should be a multiple of the number of slices in your cluster\. For more information about how to split your data into files and examples of using COPY to load data, see [Loading data from Amazon S3](t_Loading-data-from-S3.md)\.
