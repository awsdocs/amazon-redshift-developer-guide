# Data sharing concepts<a name="concepts"></a>

Following are some data sharing terms and concepts:
+ A *data share* is the unit of sharing data in Amazon Redshift\. 

  Clusters that you want to share data can create one or more data shares using `CREATE DATASHARE <sharename> ON <databasename>` command\. Each data share is associated with a specific database on the Amazon Redshift cluster\. You can add objects to the data share, such as schemas, tables, views, or SQL user\-defined functions \(UDFs\) from that database to share with other clusters for read purposes\. After adding objects, you can also specify a list of consumer clusters to which the data needs to be shared\. A cluster administrator can receive data shares from other clusters, referred to as *inbound* shares\. A cluster administrator can also create data shares to share data with other clusters, referred to as *outbound* shares\. 
+ *Data sharing producers* are clusters that you want to share data from\. Producer cluster administrators and database owners can create data shares using the `CREATE DATASHARE` command\. Each data share is associated with a specific database on the Amazon Redshift cluster\. You can add objects such as schemas, tables, views, and SQL UDFs from that database that you want the producer cluster to share with consumer clusters for read purposes\.
+ *Data sharing consumers* are clusters that receive data shares from producer clusters\. Consumer cluster administrators receive the data shares that are made available to them and review the contents of each data share\. To consume shared data, the consumer cluster administrator creates an Amazon Redshift database from the data share and then assigns permissions on the database to appropriate users and groups in the consumer cluster\. After appropriate permissions are granted, users and groups can list the shared objects as part of the standard metadata queries, along with the local data on the consumer cluster\. They can start querying immediately\.
+ *Namespaces* are identifiers that identify Amazon Redshift clusters\. A namespace globally unique identifier \(GUID\) is automatically created during Amazon Redshift cluster creation and attached to the cluster\. A namespace Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) is in the `arn:aws:redshift:{region}:{account-id}:namespace/{namespace-guid}` format\. You can see the namespace of an Amazon Redshift cluster on the cluster details page on the Amazon Redshift console\. In the data sharing workflow, the namespace GUID value and the cluster namespace ARN are used to share data with clusters in the AWS account\. You can also find the namespace for the current cluster by using the `current_namespace` function\.
