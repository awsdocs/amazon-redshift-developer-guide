# Data sharing concepts<a name="concepts"></a>

Following are some data sharing terms and concepts:
+ A *datashare* is the unit of sharing data in Amazon Redshift\. 

  For clusters that you want to share data, you can create one or more datashares using the `CREATE DATASHARE <sharename>` command\. Each datashare is associated with a specific database on your Amazon Redshift cluster\. 

  You can add objects to a datashare, such as schemas, tables, views, or SQL user\-defined functions \(UDFs\) from the associated database, to share with other clusters for read purposes\. After adding objects, you can also specify a list of cluster namespaces and AWS accounts \(preview\) to share data to\. A cluster administrator can receive datashares from other clusters, referred to as *inbound* shares\. A cluster administrator can also create datashares to share data with other clusters, referred to as *outbound* shares\. 
+ *Data producers* \(also known as data sharing producers or datashare producers\) are clusters that you want to share data from\. Producer cluster administrators and database owners can create datashares using the `CREATE DATASHARE` command\. Each datashare is associated with a specific database on the Amazon Redshift cluster\. You can add objects such as schemas, tables, views, and SQL UDFs from that database that you want the producer cluster to share with consumer clusters for read purposes\.
+ *Data consumers* \(also known as data sharing consumers or datashare consumers\) are clusters that receive datashares from producer clusters\. 

  Amazon Redshift clusters that share data can be in the same or different AWS account \(preview\), so you can share data across organizations and collaborate with other parties\. Consumer cluster administrators receive the datashares that they are granted usage for and review the contents of each datashare\. To consume shared data, the consumer cluster administrator creates an Amazon Redshift database from the datashare\. The administrator then assigns permissions for the database to users and groups in the consumer cluster\. After permissions are granted, users and groups can list the shared objects as part of the standard metadata queries, along with the local data on the consumer cluster\. They can start querying immediately\.
+ *Datashare objects* are objects from specific databases on a cluster that producer cluster administrators can add to datashares to be shared with data consumers\. Datashare objects are read\-only for data consumers\. Examples of datashare objects are tables, views, and user\-defined functions\. You can add datashare objects to datashares while creating datashares or editing a datashare at any time\.
+ *Cluster namespaces* are identifiers that identify Amazon Redshift clusters\. A namespace globally unique identifier \(GUID\) is automatically created during Amazon Redshift cluster creation and attached to the cluster\. A namespace Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) is in the `arn:aws:redshift:{region}:{account-id}:namespace/{namespace-guid}` format\. You can see the namespace of an Amazon Redshift cluster on the cluster details page on the Amazon Redshift console\. In the data sharing workflow, the namespace GUID value and the cluster namespace ARN are used to share data with clusters in the AWS account\. You can also find the namespace for the current cluster by using the `current_namespace` function\.
+ *AWS accounts* \(preview\) can be consumers for datashares and are each represented by a 12\-digit AWS account ID\.
