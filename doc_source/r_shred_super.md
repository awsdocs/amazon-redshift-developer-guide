# Shredding into SUPER columns with materialized views<a name="r_shred_super"></a>

The following example shows a materialized view that shreds the nested data with the resulting columns still being the SUPER data type\.

```
SELECT c.c_name, o.o_orderstatus
FROM customer_orders_lineitem c, c.c_orders o;
```

The following example shows a materialized view that creates conventional Amazon Redshift scalar columns from the shredded data\.

```
SELECT c.c_name, c.c_orders[0].o_totalprice
FROM customer_orders_lineitem c;
```

You can create a single materialized view super\_mv to accelerate both queries\.

To answer the first query, you must materialize the attribute o\_orderstatus\. You can omit the attribute c\_name because it doesn't involve nested navigation nor unnesting\. You must also include in the materialized view the attribute c\_custkey of customer\_orders\_lineitem to be able to join the base table with the materialized view\.

To answer the second query, you must also materialize the attribute o\_totalprice and the array index o\_idx of c\_orders\. Hence, you can access the index 0 of c\_orders\.

```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW super_mv distkey(c_custkey) sortkey(c_custkey) AS (
  SELECT c_custkey, o.o_orderstatus, o.o_totalprice, o_idx
  FROM customer_orders_lineitem c, c.c_orders o AT o_idx
);
```

The attributes o\_orderstatus and o\_totalprice of the materialized view super\_mv are SUPER\.

The materialized view super\_mv will be refreshed incrementally upon changes to the base table customer\_orders\_lineitem\.

```
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW super_mv;
INFO: Materialized view super_mv was incrementally updated successfully.
```

To rewrite the first PartiQL query as a regular SQL query, join customer\_orders\_lineitem with super\_mv as follows\.

```
SELECT c.c_name, v.o_orderstatus
FROM customer_orders_lineitem c 
JOIN super_mv v ON c.c_custkey = v.c_custkey;
```

Similarly, you can rewrite the second PartiQL query\. The following example uses a filter on o\_idx = 0\.

```
SELECT c.c_name, v.o_totalprice
FROM customer_orders_lineitem c 
JOIN super_mv v ON c.c_custkey = v.c_custkey
WHERE v.o_idx = 0;
```

In the CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW command, specify c\_custkey as distribution key and sort key for super\_mv\. Amazon Redshift performs an efficient merge join, assuming that c\_custkey is also the distribution key and sort key of customer\_orders\_lineitem\. If that isnâ€™t the case, you can specify c\_custkey as the sort key and distribution key of customer\_orders\_lineitem as follows\.

```
ALTER TABLE customer_orders_lineitem
ALTER DISTKEY c_custkey, ALTER SORTKEY (c_custkey);
```

Use the EXPLAIN statement to verify that Amazon Redshift performs a merge join on the rewritten queries\.

```
EXPLAIN SELECT c.c_name, v.o_orderstatus
FROM customer_orders_lineitem c
JOIN super_mv v ON c.c_custkey = v.c_custkey;
