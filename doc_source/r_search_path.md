# search\_path<a name="r_search_path"></a>

## Values \(default in bold\)<a name="r_search_path-values"></a>

**'$user', public, ***schema\_names*

A comma\-separated list of existing schema names\. If **'$user'** is present, then the schema having the same name as `SESSION_USER` is substituted, otherwise it is ignored\. If **public** is present and no schema with the name `public` exists, it is ignored\.

## Description<a name="r_search_path-description"></a>

Specifies the order in which schemas are searched when an object \(such as a table or a function\) is referenced by a simple name with no schema component:
+ Search paths aren't supported with external schemas and external tables\. External tables must be explicitly qualified by an external schema\.
+ When objects are created without a specific target schema, they are placed in the first schema listed in the search path\. If the search path is empty, the system returns an error\. 
+ When objects with identical names exist in different schemas, the one found first in the search path is used\. 
+ An object that isn't in any of the schemas in the search path can only be referenced by specifying its containing schema with a qualified \(dotted\) name\. 
+ The system catalog schema, pg\_catalog, is always searched\. If it is mentioned in the path, it is searched in the specified order\. If not, it is searched before any of the path items\. 
+ The current session's temporary\-table schema, pg\_temp\_nnn, is always searched if it exists\. It can be explicitly listed in the path by using the alias pg\_temp\. If it is not listed in the path, it is searched first \(even before pg\_catalog\)\. However, the temporary schema is only searched for relation names \(tables, views\)\. It is not searched for function names\. 

## Example<a name="r_search_path-example"></a>

The following example creates the schema ENTERPRISE and sets the search\_path to the new schema\.

```
create schema enterprise;
set search_path to enterprise;
show search_path;

 search_path
-------------
 enterprise
(1 row)
```

The following example adds the schema ENTERPRISE to the default search\_path\.

```
set search_path to '$user', public, enterprise;
show search_path;

         search_path
-----------------------------
 "$user", public, enterprise
(1 row)
```

The following example adds the table FRONTIER to the schema ENTERPRISE\.

```
create table enterprise.frontier (c1 int);
```

When the table PUBLIC\.FRONTIER is created in the same database, and the user does not specify the schema name in a query, PUBLIC\.FRONTIER takes precedence over ENTERPRISE\.FRONTIER\.

```
create table public.frontier(c1 int);
insert into enterprise.frontier values(1);
select * from frontier;

frontier
----
(0 rows)

select * from enterprise.frontier;

c1
----
1
(1 row)
```
