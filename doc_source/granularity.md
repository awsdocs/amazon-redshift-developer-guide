# Sharing granularity<a name="granularity"></a>

With Amazon Redshift, you can share data at different levels\. These levels include databases, schemas, tables, views \(including regular, late\-binding, and materialized views\), and SQL UDFs\. You can create multiple data shares for a given database\. A data share can contain objects from multiple schemas in the database on which sharing is created\. By having flexibility in sharing data in this manner, you get fine\-grained access control that you can tailor for different users and businesses that need access to Amazon Redshift data\.
