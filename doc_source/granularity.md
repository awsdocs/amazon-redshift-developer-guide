# Sharing data at different levels<a name="granularity"></a>

With Amazon Redshift, you can share data at different levels\. These levels include databases, schemas, tables, views \(including regular, late\-binding, and materialized views\), and SQL user\-defined functions \(UDFs\)\. You can create multiple datashares for a given database\. A datashare can contain objects from multiple schemas in the database on which sharing is created\. 

By having this flexibility in sharing data, you get fine\-grained access control\. You can tailor this control for different users and businesses that need access to Amazon Redshift data\.
