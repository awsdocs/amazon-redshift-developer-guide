Records the details for an unload operation\.

STL\_UNLOAD\_LOG records one row for each file created by an UNLOAD statement\. For example, if an UNLOAD creates 12 files, STL\_UNLOAD\_LOG will contain 12 corresponding rows\.

This view is visible to all users\. Superusers can see all rows; regular users can see only their own data\. For more information, see [Visibility of data in system tables and views](c_visibility-of-data.md)\.

## Sample query<a name="r_STL_UNLOAD_LOG-sample-query"></a>

To get a list of the files that were written to Amazon S3 by an UNLOAD command, you can call an Amazon S3 list operation after the UNLOAD completes\. You can also query STL\_UNLOAD\_LOG\.

The following query returns the pathname for files that were created by an UNLOAD for the last query executed:

```
select query, substring(path,0,40) as path
from stl_unload_log
where query = pg_last_query_id() 
order by path;
```

This command returns the following sample output: 

```
 query |             path
