| This is prerelease documentation for the machine learning feature for Amazon Redshift, which is in preview release\. The documentation and the feature are both subject to change\. We recommend that you use this feature only with test clusters, and not in production environments\. For preview terms and conditions, see Beta Service Participation in [AWS Service Terms](https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/)\.   | 

Shows useful information about a machine learning model, including its status, the parameters used to create it and the prediction function with its input argument types\. You can use the information from the SHOW MODEL to recreate the model\. If base tables have changed, running CREATE MODEL with the same SQL statement results in a different model\. The information returned by the SHOW MODEL is different for the model owner and a user with the EXECUTE privilege\. 

## Syntax<a name="r_SHOW_MODEL-synopsis"></a>

```
SHOW MODEL ( ALL | model_name )
```

## Parameters<a name="r_SHOW_MODEL-parameters"></a>

ALL   
Returns all the models that the user can use and their schemas\.

 *model\_name*   
The name of the model\. The model name in a schema must be unique\.

## Usage notes<a name="r_SHOW_MODEL_usage_notes"></a>

The SHOW MODEL command returns the following: 
+ The model name\.
+ The schema where the model was created\.
+ The owner of the model\.
+ The model creation time\.
+ The status of the model, such as READY, TRAINING, or UNDER REFRESH\.
+ The validation error if model has finished training\.
+ The estimated cost needed to derive the model\. Only the owner of the model can view this information\.
+ The specified TARGET column\.
+ A list of specified parameters and their values, specifically the following:
  + The model type, AUTO or XGBoost\.
  + The problem type, such as REGRESSION, BINARY\_CLASSIFICATION, MULTICLASS\_CLASSIFICATION\. This parameter is specific to AUTO\.
  + The objective, such as MSE, F1, Accuracy\. This parameter is specific to AUTO\.
  + The name of the created function\.
  + The prediction function input arguments\.
  + The prediction function input argument types\.
  + The IAM Role\. Only the owner of the model can see this\.
  + The S3 bucket used\. Only the owner of the model can see this\.
  + The KMS key, if one was provided\. Only the owner of the model can see this\.
  + The maximum time that the model can run\.
+ If the model type is not AUTO, then Amazon Redshift also shows the list of hyperparameters provided and their values\.

You can also view some of the information provided by SHOW MODEL in other catalog tables, such as pg\_proc\. Amazon Redshift returns information about the prediction function that is registered in pg\_proc catalog table\. This information includes the input argument names and their types for the prediction function\. Amazon Redshift returns the same information in the SHOW MODEL command\.

```
SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname ILIKE '%<function_name>%';
```

## Examples<a name="r_SHOW_MODEL-examples"></a>

The following example shows the show model output\.

```
SHOW MODEL ALL;

Schema Name |  Model Name
------------+---------------
 public     | customer_churn
```

The owner of the customer\_churn can see the following output\. A user with only the EXECUTE privilege can't see the IAM role, the Amazon S3 bucket, and the estimated cost of the mode\.

```
SHOW MODEL customer_churn;

       Key                 |           Value
