# Creating a scalar Lambda UDF<a name="udf-creating-a-lambda-sql-udf"></a>

Amazon Redshift can use custom functions defined in AWS Lambda as part of SQL queries\. You can write scalar Lambda UDFs in any programming languages supported by Lambda, such as Java, Go, PowerShell, Node\.js, C\#, Python, and Ruby\. Or you can use a custom runtime\.

Lambda UDFs are defined and managed in Lambda, and you can control the access privileges to invoke these UDFs in Amazon Redshift\. You can invoke multiple Lambda functions in the same query or invoke the same function multiple times\.

Use Lambda UDFs in any clauses of the SQL statements where scalar functions are supported\. You can also use Lambda UDFs in any SQL statement such as SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE\. 

**Note**  
Using Lambda UDFs can incur additional charges from the Lambda service\. Whether it does so depends on factors such as the numbers of Lambda requests \(UDF invocations\) and the total duration of the Lambda program execution\. However, there is no additional charge to use Lambda UDFs in Amazon Redshift\. For information about AWS Lambda pricing, see [AWS Lambda Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing)\.  
The number of Lambda requests varies depending on the specific SQL statement clause where the Lambda UDF is used\. For example, suppose the function is used in a WHERE clause such as the following\. ``  
`SELECT a, b FROM t1 WHERE lambda_multiply(a, b) = 64; SELECT a, b FROM t1 WHERE a*b = lambda_multiply(2, 32) `  
In this case, Amazon Redshift calls the first SELECT statement for each and calls the second SELECT statement only once\.  
However, using a UDF in the projection part of the query might only invoke the Lambda function once for every qualified or aggregated row in the result set\. You can configure batching of multiple invocations of your Lambda function to improve performance and lower costs\. 

## Registering a Lambda UDF<a name="udf-lambda-json"></a>

 The [CREATE EXTERNAL FUNCTION](r_CREATE_EXTERNAL_FUNCTION.md) command creates the following parameters:
+ \(Optional\) A list of arguments with data type\. 
+ One return data type\.
+ One function name of the external function that is called by Amazon Redshift\. 
+ One IAM role that the Amazon Redshift cluster is authorized to assume and call to Lambda\.
+ One Lambda function name that the Lambda UDF invokes\.

For information about CREATE EXTERNAL FUNCTION, see [CREATE EXTERNAL FUNCTION](r_CREATE_EXTERNAL_FUNCTION.md)\.

The input and return data types for this function can be any standard Amazon Redshift data type\.

Amazon Redshift ensures that the external function can send and receive batched arguments and results\. 

## Managing Lambda UDF security and privileges<a name="udf-lambda-security"></a>

To create a Lambda UDF, make sure that you have permissions for usage on the LANUGAGE EXFUNC\. You must explicitly grant USAGE ON LANGUAGE EXFUNC or revoke USAGE ON LANGUAGE EXFUNC to specific users, groups, or public\.

The following example grants usage on EXFUNC to PUBLIC\.

```
grant usage on language exfunc to PUBLIC; 
```

The following example revokes usage on exfunc from PUBLIC and then grants usage to the user group lambda\_udf\_devs\.

```
revoke usage on language exfunc from PUBLIC;
grant usage on language exfunc to group lambda_udf_devs;
```

To run a Lambda UDF, make sure that you have permission for each function called\. By default, permission to run new Lambda UDFs is granted to PUBLIC\. To restrict usage, revoke this permission from PUBLIC for the function\. Then, grant the privilege to specific users or groups\.

The following example revokes execution on the function exfunc\_sum from PUBLIC\. Then, it grants usage to the user group lambda\_udf\_devs\.

```
revoke execute on function exfunc_sum(int, int) from PUBLIC;
grant execute on function exfunc_sum(int, int) to group lambda_udf_devs;
```

Superusers have all privileges by default\.

For more information about granting and revoking privileges, see [GRANT](r_GRANT.md) and [REVOKE](r_REVOKE.md)\.

## Configuring the authorization parameter for Lambda UDFs<a name="udf-lambda-authorization"></a>

The CREATE EXTERNAL FUNCTION command requires authorization to invoke Lambda functions in AWS Lambda\. To start authorization, specify an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role when you run the CREATE EXTERNAL FUNCTION command\. For more information about IAM roles, see [IAM roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

If there is an existing IAM role with permissions to invoke Lambda functions attached to your cluster, then you can substitute your role Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) in the IAM\_ROLE parameter for the command\. Following sections describe the steps for using an IAM role in the CREATE EXTERNAL FUNCTION command\.

### Creating an IAM role for Lambda<a name="udf-lambda-create-iam"></a>

The IAM role requires permission to invoke Lambda functions\. While creating the IAM role, provide the permission in one of the following ways:
+ Attach the `AWSLambdaRole` policy on the **Attach permissions policy** page while creating an IAM role\. The `AWSLambdaRole` policy grants permissions to invoke Lambda functions which is the minimal requirement\. For more information and other policies, see [Identity\-based IAM policies for AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-identity-based.html) in the *AWS Lambda Developer Guide*\.
+ Create your own custom policy to attach to your IAM role with the `lambda:InvokeFunction` permission of either all resources or a particular Lambda function with the ARN of that function\. For more information on how to create a policy, see [Creating IAM policies](IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

  The following example policy enables invoking Lambda on a particular Lambda function\.

  ```
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Sid": "Invoke",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "lambda:InvokeFunction"
              ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

  For more information on resources for Lambda functions, see [Resources and conditions for Lambda actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-api-permissions-ref.html) in the *IAM API Reference*\.

  After creating your custom policy with the required permissions, you can attach your policy to the IAM role on the **Attach permissions policy** page while creating an IAM role\.

For steps to create an IAM role, see [Authorizing Amazon Redshift to access other AWS services on your behalf](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/authorizing-redshift-service.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*\.

If you don't want to create a new IAM role, you can add the permissions mentioned previously to your existing IAM role\.

### Associating an IAM role with the cluster<a name="udf-lambda-associate-iam"></a>

Attach the IAM role to your cluster\. You can add a role to a cluster or view the roles associated with a cluster by using the Amazon Redshift Management Console, CLI, or API\. For more information, see [Associating an IAM Role With a Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/copy-unload-iam-role.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide*\.

### Including the IAM role in the command<a name="udf-lambda-include-iam"></a>

Include the IAM role ARN in the CREATE EXTERNAL FUNCTION command\. When you create an IAM role, IAM returns an Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) for the role\. To specify an IAM role, provide the role ARN with the `IAM_ROLE` parameter\. The following shows the syntax for the `IAM_ROLE` parameter\.

```
IAM_ROLE 'arn:aws:iam::aws-account-id:role/role-name'
```

To invoke Lambda functions which reside in other accounts within the same Region, see [Chaining IAM roles in Amazon Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/authorizing-redshift-service.html#authorizing-redshift-service-chaining-roles.html)\.

## Using the JSON interface between Amazon Redshift and AWS Lambda<a name="udf-lambda-json"></a>

Amazon Redshift uses a common interface for all Lambda functions that Amazon Redshift communicates to\.

The following table shows the list of input fields that the designated Lambda functions that you can expect for the JSON payload\.

[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/udf-creating-a-lambda-sql-udf.html)

The order of the JSON array determines the order of batch processing\. The Lambda function must precess the arguments iteratively and produce the exact number of records\. The following is an example of a payload\. 

```
{
  "request_id" : "23FF1F97-F28A-44AA-AB67-266ED976BF40",
  "cluster" : 'arn:aws:redshift:xxxx',
  "user" : "master",
  "database" : "db1",
  "external_function": "public.foo",
  "query_id" : 5678234,
  "num_records" : 4,
  "arguments" : [
     [ 1, 2 ],
     [ 3, null],
     null,
     [ 4, 6]
   ]
 }
```

The return output of the Lambda function contains the following fields\.

[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/udf-creating-a-lambda-sql-udf.html)

The following is an example of the Lambda function output\.

```
{
  "success": true,   // true indicates the call succeeded
  "error_msg" : "my function isn't working",  // shall only exist when success != true
  "num_records": 4,      // number of records in this payload
  "results" : [
     1,
     4,
     null,
     7
   ]
}
```

When you call Lambda functions from SQL queries, Amazon Redshift ensures the security of the connection with the following considerations:
+ GRANT and REVOKE permissions\. For more information about UDF security and privileges, see [UDF security and privileges](udf-security-and-privileges.md)\.
+ Amazon Redshift only submits the minimum set of data to the designated Lambda function\.
+ Amazon Redshift only calls the designated Lambda function with the designated IAM role\.
