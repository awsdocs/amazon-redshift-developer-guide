# Terms and concepts for Amazon Redshift ML<a name="terminology"></a>

The following terms are used to describe some Amazon Redshift ML concepts:
+ *Machine learning* in Amazon Redshift trains a model with one SQL command\. Amazon Redshift ML and Amazon SageMaker manage all the data conversions, permissions, resource usage, and discovery of the proper model\. 
+ *Training* is the phase when Amazon Redshift creates a machine learning model by running a specified subset of data into the model\. Amazon Redshift automatically launches a training job in Amazon SageMaker and generates a model\. 
+ *Prediction* \(also called inference\) is the use of the model in Amazon Redshift SQL queries to predict outcomes\. At inference time, Amazon Redshift uses a model\-based prediction function as part of a larger query to produce predictions\. The predictions are computed locally, at the Amazon Redshift cluster, thus providing high throughput, low latency, and zero cost\.

Also important are the following:
+ *Amazon SageMaker* is a fully managed machine learning service\. With Amazon SageMaker, data scientists and developers can easily build, train and then directly deploy models into a production\-ready hosted environment\. For information about Amazon SageMaker, see [What is Amazon SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html) in the *Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide*\.
+ *Amazon SageMaker Autopilot* is a feature set that automatically trains and tunes the best machine learning models for classification or regression, based on your data\. At the same time, you maintain full control and visibility\. Amazon SageMaker Autopilot supports input data in tabular format, with automatic data cleaning and preprocessing, automatic algorithm selection for linear regression, binary classification, and multiclass classification\. It also supports automatic hyperparameter optimization \(HPO\), distributed training, automatic instance, and cluster size selection\. For information about Amazon SageMaker Autopilot, see [Automate model development with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-automate-model-development.html) in the *Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide*\.
