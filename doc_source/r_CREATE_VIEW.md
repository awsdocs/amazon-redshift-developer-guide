# CREATE VIEW<a name="r_CREATE_VIEW"></a>

Creates a view in a database\. The view isn't physically materialized; the query that defines the view is run every time the view is referenced in a query\. To create a view with an external table, include the WITH NO SCHEMA BINDING clause\.

To create a standard view, you need access to the underlying tables\. To query a standard view, you need select privileges for the view itself, but you don't need select privileges for the underlying tables\. To query a late binding view, you need select privileges for the late binding view itself\. You should also make sure the owner of the late binding view has select privileges to the referenced objects \(tables, views, or user\-defined functions\)\. For more information about Late Binding Views, see [Usage notes](#r_CREATE_VIEW_usage_notes)\.

## Syntax<a name="r_CREATE_VIEW-synopsis"></a>

```
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] VIEW name [ ( column_name [, ...] ) ] AS query
[ WITH NO SCHEMA BINDING ]
```

## Parameters<a name="r_CREATE_VIEW-parameters"></a>

OR REPLACE   
If a view of the same name already exists, the view is replaced\. You can only replace a view with a new query that generates the identical set of columns, using the same column names and data types\. CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW locks the view for reads and writes until the operation completes\.

 *name*   
The name of the view\. If a schema name is given \(such as `myschema.myview`\) the view is created using the specified schema\. Otherwise, the view is created in the current schema\. The view name must be different from the name of any other view or table in the same schema\.   
If you specify a view name that begins with '\# ', the view is created as a temporary view that is visible only in the current session\.  
For more information about valid names, see [Names and identifiers](r_names.md)\. You can't create tables or views in the system databases template0, template1, and padb\_harvest\.

 *column\_name*   
Optional list of names to be used for the columns in the view\. If no column names are given, the column names are derived from the query\. The maximum number of columns you can define in a single view is 1,600\.

 *query*   
A query \(in the form of a SELECT statement\) that evaluates to a table\. This table defines the columns and rows in the view\. 

 WITH NO SCHEMA BINDING   
Clause that specifies that the view isn't bound to the underlying database objects, such as tables and user\-defined functions\. As a result, there is no dependency between the view and the objects it references\. You can create a view even if the referenced objects don't exist\. Because there is no dependency, you can drop or alter a referenced object without affecting the view\. Amazon Redshift doesn't check for dependencies until the view is queried\. To view details about late binding views, run the [PG\_GET\_LATE\_BINDING\_VIEW\_COLS](PG_GET_LATE_BINDING_VIEW_COLS.md) function\.  
When you include the WITH NO SCHEMA BINDING clause, tables and views referenced in the SELECT statement must be qualified with a schema name\. The schema must exist when the view is created, even if the referenced table doesn't exist\. For example, the following statement returns an error\.   

```
create view myevent as select eventname from event
with no schema binding;
```
The following statement executes successfully\.  

```
create view myevent as select eventname from public.event
with no schema binding;
```

**Note**  
You can't update, insert into, or delete from a view\. 

## Usage notes<a name="r_CREATE_VIEW_usage_notes"></a>



### Late\-binding views<a name="r_CREATE_VIEW_late-binding-views"></a>

A late\-binding view doesn't check the underlying database objects, such as tables and other views, until the view is queried\. As a result, you can alter or drop the underlying objects without dropping and recreating the view\. If you drop underlying objects, queries to the late\-binding view will fail\. If the query to the late\-binding view references columns in the underlying object that aren't present, the query will fail\. 

 If you drop and then re\-create a late\-binding view's underlying table or view, the new object is created with default access permissions\. You might need to grant permissions to the underling objects for users who will query the view\. 

To create a late\-binding view, include the WITH NO SCHEMA BINDING clause\. The following example creates a view with no schema binding\. 

```
create view event_vw as select * from public.event
with no schema binding;

select * from event_vw limit 1;

eventid | venueid | catid | dateid | eventname     | starttime          
--------+---------+-------+--------+---------------+--------------------
      2 |     306 |     8 |   2114 | Boris Godunov | 2008-10-15 20:00:00
```

The following example shows that you can alter an underlying table without recreating the view\. 

```
alter table event rename column eventname to title;

select * from event_vw limit 1;

eventid | venueid | catid | dateid | title         | starttime          
--------+---------+-------+--------+---------------+--------------------
      2 |     306 |     8 |   2114 | Boris Godunov | 2008-10-15 20:00:00
```

You can reference Amazon Redshift Spectrum external tables only in a late\-binding view\. One application of late\-binding views is to query both Amazon Redshift and Redshift Spectrum tables\. For example, you can use the [UNLOAD](r_UNLOAD.md) command to archive older data to Amazon S3\. Then, create a Redshift Spectrum external table that references the data on Amazon S3 and create a view that queries both tables\. The following example uses a UNION ALL clause to join the Amazon Redshift `SALES` table and the Redshift Spectrum `SPECTRUM.SALES` table\.

```
create view sales_vw as
select * from public.sales
union all
select * from spectrum.sales
with no schema binding;
```

For more information about creating Redshift Spectrum external tables, including the `SPECTRUM.SALES` table, see [Getting started with Amazon Redshift Spectrum](c-getting-started-using-spectrum.md)\.

## Examples<a name="r_CREATE_VIEW-examples"></a>

The following command creates a view called *myevent* from a table called EVENT\. 

```
create view myevent as select eventname from event
where eventname = 'LeAnn Rimes';
```

The following command creates a view called* myuser* from a table called USERS\. 

```
create view myuser as select lastname from users;
```

The following command creates or replaces a view called* myuser* from a table called USERS\. 

```
create or replace view myuser as select lastname from users;
```

The following example creates a view with no schema binding\. 

```
create view myevent as select eventname from public.event
with no schema binding;
```
