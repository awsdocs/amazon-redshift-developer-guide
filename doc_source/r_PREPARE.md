# PREPARE<a name="r_PREPARE"></a>

Prepare a statement for execution\. 

PREPARE creates a prepared statement\. When the PREPARE statement is executed, the specified statement \(SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE\) is parsed, rewritten, and planned\. When an EXECUTE command is then issued for the prepared statement, Amazon Redshift may optionally revise the query execution plan \(to improve performance based on the specified parameter values\) before executing the prepared statement\. 

## Syntax<a name="r_PREPARE-synopsis"></a>

```
PREPARE plan_name [ (datatype [, ...] ) ] AS statement
```

## Parameters<a name="r_PREPARE-parameters"></a>

 *plan\_name*   
An arbitrary name given to this particular prepared statement\. It must be unique within a single session and is subsequently used to execute or deallocate a previously prepared statement\.

 *datatype*   
The data type of a parameter to the prepared statement\. To refer to the parameters in the prepared statement itself, use $1, $2, and so on\.

 *statement *   
Any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement\.

## Usage notes<a name="r_PREPARE_usage_notes"></a>

Prepared statements can take parameters: values that are substituted into the statement when it is executed\. To include parameters in a prepared statement, supply a list of data types in the PREPARE statement, and, in the statement to be prepared itself, refer to the parameters by position using the notation $1, $2, \.\.\. When executing the statement, specify the actual values for these parameters in the EXECUTE statement\. For more details, see [EXECUTE](r_EXECUTE.md)\. 

Prepared statements only last for the duration of the current session\. When the session ends, the prepared statement is discarded, so it must be re\-created before being used again\. This also means that a single prepared statement can't be used by multiple simultaneous database clients; however, each client can create its own prepared statement to use\. The prepared statement can be manually removed using the DEALLOCATE command\. 

Prepared statements have the largest performance advantage when a single session is being used to execute a large number of similar statements\. As mentioned, for each new execution of a prepared statement, Amazon Redshift may revise the query execution plan to improve performance based on the specified parameter values\. To examine the query execution plan that Amazon Redshift has chosen for any specific EXECUTE statements, use the [EXPLAIN](r_EXPLAIN.md) command\. 

For more information on query planning and the statistics collected by Amazon Redshift for query optimization, see the [ANALYZE](r_ANALYZE.md) command\. 

## Examples<a name="sub-examples-prepare"></a>

Create a temporary table, prepare INSERT statement and then execute it:

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS prep1;
CREATE TABLE prep1 (c1 int, c2 char(20));
PREPARE prep_insert_plan (int, char)
AS insert into prep1 values ($1, $2);
EXECUTE prep_insert_plan (1, 'one');
EXECUTE prep_insert_plan (2, 'two');
EXECUTE prep_insert_plan (3, 'three');
DEALLOCATE prep_insert_plan;
```

Prepare a SELECT statement and then execute it:

```
PREPARE prep_select_plan (int) 
AS select * from prep1 where c1 = $1;
EXECUTE prep_select_plan (2);
EXECUTE prep_select_plan (3);
DEALLOCATE prep_select_plan;
```
