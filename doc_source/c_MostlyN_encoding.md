# Mostly encoding<a name="c_MostlyN_encoding"></a>

Mostly encodings are useful when the data type for a column is larger than most of the stored values require\. By specifying a mostly encoding for this type of column, you can compress the majority of the values in the column to a smaller standard storage size\. The remaining values that cannot be compressed are stored in their raw form\. For example, you can compress a 16\-bit column, such as an INT2 column, to 8\-bit storage\.

In general, the mostly encodings work with the following data types:
+ SMALLINT/INT2 \(16\-bit\)
+ INTEGER/INT \(32\-bit\)
+ BIGINT/INT8 \(64\-bit\)
+ DECIMAL/NUMERIC \(64\-bit\)

Choose the appropriate variation of the mostly encoding to suit the size of the data type for the column\. For example, apply MOSTLY8 to a column that is defined as a 16\-bit integer column\. Applying MOSTLY16 to a column with a 16\-bit data type or MOSTLY32 to a column with a 32\-bit data type is disallowed\.

Mostly encodings might be less effective than no compression when a relatively high number of the values in the column cannot be compressed\. Before applying one of these encodings to a column, perform a check\. *Most* of the values that you are going to load now \(and are likely to load in the future\) should fit into the ranges shown in the following table\.

**Note**  
For decimal values, ignore the decimal point to determine whether the value fits into the range\. For example, 1,234\.56 is treated as 123,456 and can be compressed in a MOSTLY32 column\.

For example, the VENUEID column in the VENUE table is defined as a raw integer column, which means that its values consume 4 bytes of storage\. However, the current range of values in the column is **0** to **309**\. Therefore, recreating and reloading this table with MOSTLY16 encoding for VENUEID would reduce the storage of every value in that column to 2 bytes\.

If the VENUEID values referenced in another table were mostly in the range of 0 to 127, it might make sense to encode that foreign\-key column as MOSTLY8\. Before making the choice, you have to run some queries against the referencing table data to find out whether the values mostly fall into the 8\-bit, 16\-bit, or 32\-bit range\.

The following table shows compressed sizes for specific numeric values when the MOSTLY8, MOSTLY16, and MOSTLY32 encodings are used:
