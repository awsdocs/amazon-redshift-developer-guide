This section describes the basic steps to begin using the Amazon Redshift database\.

The examples in this section assume you have signed up for the Amazon Redshift data warehouse service, created a cluster, and established a connection to the cluster from your SQL client tool such at the Amazon Redshift console query editor\. For information about these tasks, see [Amazon Redshift Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/)\.

**Important**  
The cluster that you deployed for this exercise will be running in a live environment\. As long as it is running, it will accrue charges to your AWS account\. For more pricing information, go to [the Amazon Redshift pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/pricing/)\.   
To avoid unnecessary charges, you should delete your cluster when you are done with it\. The final step of the exercise explains how to do so\.
