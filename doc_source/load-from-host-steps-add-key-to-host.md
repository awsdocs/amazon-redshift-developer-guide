# Step 2: Add the Amazon Redshift cluster public key to the host's authorized keys file<a name="load-from-host-steps-add-key-to-host"></a>

You add the cluster public key to each host's authorized keys file so that the host will recognize Amazon Redshift and accept the SSH connection\. 

**To add the Amazon Redshift cluster public key to the host's authorized keys file**

1. Access the host using an SSH connection\. 

   For information about connecting to an instance using SSH, see [Connect to Your Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-connect-to-instance-linux.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*\. 

1. Copy the Amazon Redshift public key from the console or from the CLI response text\. 

1. Copy and paste the contents of the public key into the `/home/<ssh_username>/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote host\. The `<ssh_username>` must match the value for the "username" field in the manifest file\. Include the complete string, including the prefix "`ssh-rsa` " and suffix "`Amazon-Redshift`"\. For example: 

   ```
   ssh-rsa AAAACTP3isxgGzVWoIWpbVvRCOzYdVifMrhâ€¦ uA70BnMHCaMiRdmvsDOedZDOedZ Amazon-Redshift
   ```
