# Visibility of data in system tables and views<a name="c_visibility-of-data"></a>

There are two classes of visibility for data in system tables and views: visible to users and visible to superusers\.

Only users with superuser privileges can see the data in those tables that are in the superuser\-visible category\. Regular users can see data in the user\-visible tables\. To give a regular user access to superuser\-visible tables, [GRANT](r_GRANT.md) SELECT privilege on that table to the regular user\.

By default, in most user\-visible tables, rows generated by another user are invisible to a regular user\. If a regular user is given unrestricted [SYSLOG ACCESS](r_ALTER_USER.md#alter-user-syslog-access), that user can see all rows in user\-visible tables, including rows generated by another user\. For more information, see [ALTER USER](r_ALTER_USER.md) or [CREATE USER](r_CREATE_USER.md)\. All rows in STV\_RECENTS and SVV\_TRANSACTIONS are visible to all users\. 

**Note**  
Giving a user unrestricted access to system tables gives the user visibility to data generated by other users\. For example, STL\_QUERY and STL\_QUERY\_TEXT contain the full text of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements, which might contain sensitive user\-generated data\. 

A superuser can see all rows in all tables\. To give a regular user access to superuser\-visible tables, [GRANT](r_GRANT.md) SELECT privilege on that table to the regular user\.

## Filtering system\-generated queries<a name="sub-c_visibility-of-data-filtering"></a>

The query\-related system tables and views, such as SVL\_QUERY\_SUMMARY, SVL\_QLOG, and others, usually contain a large number of automatically generated statements that Amazon Redshift uses to monitor the status of the database\. These system\-generated queries are visible to a superuser, but are seldom useful\. To filter them out when selecting from a system table or system view that uses the `userid` column, add the condition `userid > 1` to the WHERE clause\. For example:

```
 select * from svl_query_summary where userid > 1
```
